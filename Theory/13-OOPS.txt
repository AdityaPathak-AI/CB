# 4 Pillars of OOPS

1.Encapsulation
2.Abstraction
3.Inheritance
4.Polymorphism

#Key Things

Class.
Object.
Instance.
Constructor.



# OBJECTS

The Object type represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. 

1.Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
2.Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
3.Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
4.Dates are always objects
5.Maths are always objects
6.Regular expressions are always objects
7.Arrays are always objects
8.Functions are always objects
9.Objects are always objects
10.All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

#Key Points
1.JavaScript variables can also contain many values.
2.Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
3.Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
4.It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.

const person = {
    firstName:"Zorawar", 
    lastName:"Singh", 
    age:20, 
    eyeColor:"brown"
};
