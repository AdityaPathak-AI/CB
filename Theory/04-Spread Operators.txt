Definition :-
The spread operator (...) is a syntax in JavaScript that allows the expansion or spreading of elements from an iterable (like an array or a string) or the properties from an object. It provides a concise way to copy arrays, concatenate arrays, and create shallow copies of objects.


Example-1
const numberOne = [1,2,3];
const numberTwo = [4,5,6];
const numebrsCombined = [...numberOne , ...numberTwo];

Example-2

<script>

const myVehicle = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  color: 'red'
}
const updateMyVehicle = {
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'yellow'
}

const myUpdatedVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle}
console.log(myUpdatedVehicle);

</script>

o/p

{
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  color: 'yellow',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021
}

Spread Operator can perform many things some of them are:-

1.Copy an array

const arr1 = [1,2,3,4];
const arr2 = [...arr1];

console.log(arr2)

2. Concatenate an array

const arr1 = [1,2,3,4];
const arr2 = [2,5,7,9];
const arr3 = [...arr1,...arr2];
console.log(arr3);

Fun Fact :- 
Overlapping of values only takes place in objects , in arrays it concatenate both the arrays.
While in objects it update the object and remove common values.
